Our goal:

We are interested to measures the memory bandwith available on the processor during run of one and multiple serial run.
The hypothesis is that bandwidth for single process is larger then when many processes run at the same time and compete for it.

Setup of the experiment:
These tests are runned on the  ICS to start study the performaces with likwid, next step would be to 
move on these tests on the DXT cluster.


To run the experiment run the following command:
1. At first we need to know the include and library paths for LIKWID. There is no common way but if you used the default build process you can use this:

source load_path.sh

2. compile the membench.c file with likwid Maker API

make membench-likwid

3. execute the test: Run the application serially, son Socker 0 core 0 and save the results about L3 cache peformance into res folder:

likwid-perfctr -C S0:0 -g L3 -m ./membench > res/res.txt
